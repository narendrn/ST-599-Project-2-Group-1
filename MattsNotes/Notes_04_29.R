## Matt's Notes 4/29

Airport_ID is not in this database? will have to use 'origin' field for airports.

And finding a csv list of airport codes is proving annoying.
(4/30 - there was one linked from the project webpage, which is the same thing I found. oy.)


## 4/30 Lecture
- Alix
Treat airlines and airports as constant through time.

how do airlines/airports differ based on question of interest?

may be able to change the question, if needed. but try to tackle the original question first.


Survey package in R may be able to do some of this for us.


 - Charlotte:

  AVG function DROPS missing values by defaults. (can you find out how many NAs there were?)
can talk in the select statement about SQL specific functions


"n=1000L" # capital L specifically states that it's an integer, rather than a real or a double. necessary here. command expects integer # of rows.

there are more efficient ways to get a random sample from a database
